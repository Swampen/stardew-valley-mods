Reminds you in the morning when the Queen of Sauce program is airing on TV.
I made this mod because I always forgot to watch it.

## Compiling
To compile a SMAPI mod for testing, use the following instructions:

2. Open the solution with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop.
3. Add the package [Stardew.ModBuildConfig](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig) by Pathoschild to enable cross-platform compatibility.
4. Re-build the solution and run the debugger to launch the project with SMAPI.
